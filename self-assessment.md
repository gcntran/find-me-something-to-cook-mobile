This is also my first time doing the documentation, and I am not sure if it's correct. I used README.md for the documentation.
It's difficult to make the app look exactly like the wireframe.
I tried applying the theme, but the dark mode didn't work on the navigation bars. 
I made a dynamic app because I had to fetch the data from an API, so it's more difficult than the examples. But I want to try doing that instead of only doing the small thing. My curiosity really pushes me work harder for this assignment.
The ScrollView is very useful for any app; I applied using it and enjoyed it.
Of course, I asked AI to help me a lot with this assignment. I used Copilot installed in VS Code, and it helped me to explain which part I couldn't understand. I also kept all the logs inside the Typescript files.
